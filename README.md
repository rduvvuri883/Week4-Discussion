What are containers?

Container in cloud computing is basically an approach to operating system virtualization. By this, the user can work with a program and its dependencies
using resource procedures that are isolated. The code of the application can be bundled with configurations and dependencies in a systematic manner.
Container in cloud computing is used to build blocks, which help in producing operational efficiency, version control, developer productivity and
environmental consistency. By this, the user is assured of reliability, consistency, and quickness regardless of the distributed platform. The infrastructure
is enhanced since the container in cloud computing provides more control over the granular activities on resources. The container usage in online services
benefits storage with cloud computing information security, availability and elasticity.


What problem do containers solve?
The Consistency in Cloud Storage: The container enhances portability. It eliminates the organizational and technical frictions so that the program moves through
the entire process cycle. It encapsulates the core files of an application and software server and dependencies like a building block.

Application Version Control: Through container in cloud computing, the users can look on the current version of the application code as well as their dependencies.
A manifest file is managed by the Docker containers. The users can easily hold and track the editions of container, look for differences between the container editions
and roll-back to earlier versions if needed.

Efficiency in the Operational Activities: The users can achieve more resources through the container in cloud computing. By this, the users can also work at a time on
several applications. The required memory, disk space and CPU consumed by the container have to be specified. Since each of the containers is a process of the operating
system that works on an application and associated programs, the containers have a fast boot time. The users can quickly enter and exit the application and also measure
it in up and down.

Productivity of the Developers: The containers deduct the dependencies and conflicts between the cross-service and thus the productivity increases.


What is the relationship between Kubernetes and containers?

Kubernetes is an open-source container management software developed in the Google platform. Docker is an open-source lightweight containerization technology. Kubernetes offers a feature of automated scheduling. Docker offers an isolated environment for managing your applications. (Courtesy:- WWW)

Post a screenshot of a lab where you had difficulty with a concept or learned something.

Lab helped me understand the implementation of kubernetes on the cloud platform at a high level.
